"""Phase 2 API contract — Pydantic 2 models shared between the frontend
and the FastAPI backend. See `endpoints.md` for the endpoint catalog and
`README.md` for a consumer guide.

Usage::

    from backend.contract import User, Task, Team, AuthResponse, Paginated

`TokenClaims` is intentionally not re-exported — it describes the JWT
payload shape for documentation only and is not a request/response body.
