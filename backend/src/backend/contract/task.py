"""Task shapes — the user-facing merged view (global definition + caller
state) plus the discriminated form-body union for submissions.

Derivation rules (server-authoritative; frontend must match):
  * `status == "locked"` iff any id in `requires` is not in the caller's
    set of completed task ids.
  * `status == "expired"` iff `due_at` is in the past and the caller has
    not completed the task.
  * `progress` is authoritative; clients display `steps[].done` for the
    checklist UX but never compute `progress` from it.
