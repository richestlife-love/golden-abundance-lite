"""Truncate seed-owned tables so the next `just seed` re-creates them.
Refuses to run in production.

Tables truncated (CASCADE handles FK fan-out):
  * task_defs — task definitions
  * news_items — news feed
  * users — every user (cascades to teams, team_memberships, join_requests,
    rewards, task_progress, etc.)

This is intentionally a hard reset: a partial reset (e.g. only DEMO_USERS)
would leave dangling teams from prior runs and isn't worth the complexity
for a dev-only recipe.
