"""Team membership mutations: join-request lifecycle and leave.

Kept separate from `services.team` because the join/approve/reject/leave
flow has its own invariants (one pending request, one membership, leader
self-join forbidden) and its own reward-cascade side effect via
``approve_join_request``.
