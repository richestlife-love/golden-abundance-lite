    Caller is responsible for committing — this function only
    ``flush()``es (inside a savepoint) so the new row has relationships
    but sits in the session's identity map.

    Concurrent first-sign-ins are handled internally:

    - **PK collision** (two requests for the same ``sub``): the loser's
      savepoint rolls back, a re-fetch by PK finds the winner's row, and
      that row is returned.
    - **display_id collision** (two different ``sub``s whose emails
      resolve to the same candidate): the loser's savepoint rolls back
      and the retry re-generates a candidate against the now-committed
      winner, picking a fresh suffix.

    Still not handled: a Supabase user deleted + recreated (same email,
    new ``sub``) colliding with the existing ``UserRow.email`` unique
    constraint. That one propagates as ``IntegrityError`` after
    ``_UPSERT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` — retry can't help because the email is
    the same each time.
