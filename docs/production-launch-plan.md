# Production Launch Plan

High-level task list for moving from single-file prototype to production app with a Python FastAPI backend.

## Phase 1 — Build system + modules
- [x] Migrate frontend to Vite
- [x] Split `app.jsx` into per-component files
- [x] Add TypeScript; derive types from existing mock data shapes
- [x] Format with Prettier

## Phase 2 — API contract first
See the [design spec](superpowers/specs/2026-04-19-api-contract-design.md).

- [x] Define Pydantic models under `backend/src/backend/contract/` (User, Task, Team, Rank, Rewards, News, auth, form bodies)
- [x] Write endpoint catalog markdown alongside the models
- [x] Validate JSON fixtures against the models via a smoke test (`just contract-validate`)
- [ ] ~~Stub FastAPI endpoints returning mock data server-side~~ — deferred to Phase 5 (runnable server lives with persistence)
- [ ] ~~Validate wire format end-to-end (no persistence yet)~~ — replaced by fixture validation above; end-to-end happens in Phase 4 when the frontend wires up

## Phase 3 — Routing
- [x] Replace `useState("screen")` with React Router or TanStack Router
- [x] Map screens to URLs (`/`, `/home`, `/tasks/:id`, `/me`, etc.)
- [x] Verify bookmarkable URLs and browser back/forward

## Phase 4 — Wire frontend to backend
- [x] Add TanStack Query for data fetching, cache, loading/error states (Phase 4a)
- [ ] Replace in-file mock arrays with real fetches (Phase 4b read-side, Phase 4c write-side)

## Phase 5 — Persistence
- [x] Add Postgres via SQLModel
- [x] Set up Alembic migrations
- [x] Implement CRUD for each resource

See Phase 5 sub-plans:
- [5a Foundation](superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-phase-5a-foundation.md)
- [5b Auth](superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-phase-5b-auth.md)
- [5c Teams](superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-phase-5c-teams.md)
- [5d Content](superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-phase-5d-content.md)
- [5e Polish](superpowers/plans/2026-04-19-phase-5e-polish.md)

Phase 5 ships the persistence layer + runnable backend via five sub-plans:
- **5a Foundation:** FastAPI + SQLModel + Postgres scaffold, `/health`, 11 tables, testcontainers harness.
- **5b Auth:** HS256 JWT + Google ID-token stub, `/auth/google`, `/auth/logout`, `/me`.
- **5c Teams:** profile completion, `/teams/*`, join-request workflow, `/me/teams`.
- **5d Content:** `/tasks/*`, `/me/tasks`, `/me/rewards`, `/rank/{users,teams}`, `/news`.
- **5e Polish:** idempotent dev seed (T1-T4 + 3 news items), `just seed` recipe.

Backend now serves every endpoint listed in `backend/src/backend/contract/endpoints.md`.

## Phase 6 — Auth
- [ ] Decide: Clerk / Supabase Auth vs. roll-your-own Google OAuth
- [ ] Integrate auth provider on frontend
- [ ] Protect FastAPI routes with session/token verification

## Phase 7 — Deploy
- [ ] Deploy frontend (Vercel / Netlify)
- [ ] Deploy backend (Railway / Fly / Render)
- [ ] Provision managed Postgres
- [ ] Configure env vars per environment

## Key tradeoffs
- **Reuse vs. rebuild** — keep components as-is; wrap new architecture around them
- **Auth lift** — Clerk/Supabase = hours; DIY OAuth = ~a week
- **TypeScript timing** — add in Phase 1; retrofitting after Phase 3 is painful

## Tech debt / review findings (pre-Phase-4)

Items surfaced in a 2026-04-20 code review. Address before or during Phase 4 (wire to backend) — once fetch/loading state is threaded through the tree, each of these becomes significantly more painful to refactor. Phase 3 status updates noted per item.

### State architecture
- **`AppStateContext.tsx` holds the whole domain** — all state (`tasks`, `ledTeam`, `joinedTeam`, `successData`) and every handler live in one provider at [`../frontend/src/state/AppStateContext.tsx`](../frontend/src/state/AppStateContext.tsx). Phase 3 replaced `App.tsx` with this provider but didn't split it; every `useAppState()` consumer re-renders on any state change. Split into focused reducers (tasks vs. teams) or a small Zustand store before Phase 4 so per-resource fetch/loading/error slots slot in cleanly instead of bloating this file further.
- **Task-3 "team progress" is double-stored** — [`syncTeamTask` at AppStateContext.tsx:62-83](../frontend/src/state/AppStateContext.tsx#L62) mirrors team membership into `tasks[idx].teamProgress/status/progress`, so the same fact lives in two places. Derive it via a selector from `(ledTeam, joinedTeam, tasks)` instead — one source of truth eliminates an entire class of drift bugs.
- **Setter-inside-setter in `handleProfileComplete`** — [`AppStateContext.tsx:96-134`](../frontend/src/state/AppStateContext.tsx#L96) calls `setLedTeam` and `syncTeamTask` inside the `setUser` updater, which React 18 StrictMode dev invokes twice. Compute `merged` and `myTeam` outside the updater, then call the setters sequentially.

### Mock-data boundaries
- **Hardcoded mock join requests** — the 林詠瑜 / 陳志豪 / 王美玲 pending-request seed lives inside `handleProfileComplete` at [`AppStateContext.tsx:125-127`](../frontend/src/state/AppStateContext.tsx#L125). Move to `data.ts` as a `DEMO_REQUESTS` export, or gate behind `import.meta.env.DEV` so the demo seed doesn't ship to prod.
- **`simulateJoinApproved` is demo-only, runtime-visible** — Phase 3 replaced the `onSimulateJoinApproved` prop with a context method. The call site in `MyScreen` carries an inline `// demo-only` comment. Still needs a build-flag gate (`import.meta.env.DEV`) so the demo button can't fire in prod builds.
- **`RankScreen.tsx` is ~43KB** — almost entirely mock leaderboard + challenge data at roughly [lines 136-870](../frontend/src/screens/RankScreen.tsx#L136). Extract to `src/data/mock-rankings.ts` now; Phase 4 replaces this with fetch calls anyway, and doing the split first makes that diff legible instead of tangled with the fetch migration.

### Identity
- **`userIdFromEmail`** — [`AppStateContext.tsx:35-45`](../frontend/src/state/AppStateContext.tsx#L35) derives a user id from the email local part (first 4–6 chars uppercased). Collision-prone (e.g. `jet.a@…` and `jet.b@…` collapse to the same id), and that id is then used as the root of the team id (`T-${idSuffix}`), so the collision propagates. Replace with server-issued UUIDs at Phase 4.

## Tech debt / review findings (Phase 3)

Surfaced during Phase 3 (TanStack Router migration). Most items are design trade-offs to revisit in Phase 4 or Phase 6, not bugs.

### Route architecture
- **Flat route tree, not nested layouts** — `/me/profile`, `/me/profile/edit`, `/tasks/:id`, `/tasks/:id/start` are all direct children of `_authed` with full paths, rather than nested children whose parents render an `<Outlet />`. Nested-layout attempts during Phase 3 caused screen-stacking bugs (parent + child rendered simultaneously in the same viewport) and got flattened — see commits `5e93f67` (`/me`), `56f486a` (`/tasks/:id`), and `b8edb22` (`/tasks/:id/start`). If Phase 4 wants shared "me section chrome" or shared loading state across task routes, revisit by giving the parent screens explicit layout responsibilities and an `<Outlet />`.
- **`/me/profile/edit` sentinel is shadowed by the `_authed` guard** — the edit route's `beforeLoad` checks `location.state.fromProfile` and redirects if missing, but for incomplete-profile users the `_authed` guard catches first (→ `/welcome`). Only reachable branch is "complete user, direct URL". Not a bug; worth noting if someone simplifies the guard chain later.
- **`router.invalidate()` on every auth-state change** — [`../frontend/src/main.tsx`](../frontend/src/main.tsx)'s `AppShell` re-evaluates all route guards whenever `user` or `profileComplete` changes. Fine today; Phase 6 (real auth with token refresh) should audit whether invalidation should be more targeted (e.g., invalidate only routes under `_authed`).

### Lint
- **`react-refresh/only-export-components` warnings on route + context modules** — 11 warnings across `src/routes/*.tsx` (including `__root.tsx`), `src/main.tsx`, `src/state/AppStateContext.tsx`, and `src/test/renderRoute.tsx`, caused by modules exporting both a component and a route object (or a provider + a hook). Low priority. Either disable the rule for `src/routes/**` + `src/state/**` in ESLint config, or split the route object into a sibling `*.route.ts` file and the hook into a sibling `*.hooks.ts`.

### Mixed-script source text
- **Traditional / Simplified Chinese mismatch across UI copy** — `LandingScreen`, `BottomNav`, `RewardsScreen` render Simplified (开启, 首页, 任务, 排行, 我的); `GoogleAuthScreen`, `data.ts` task titles, `ProfileSetupForm` labels render Traditional (選擇帳號, 組隊挑戰, 編輯個人資料). Test assertions had to grep the source per call to know which variant to match. Pick one script for the Chinese UI (likely Simplified given `LandingScreen`/`BottomNav` lead) and sweep the remaining files.

## Tech debt / review findings (Phase 5a)

Surfaced during Phase 5a (backend foundation — FastAPI + SQLModel + Alembic + testcontainers). Address as each becomes actionable in Phase 5b / 5c.

### Async / event-loop plumbing
- **`alembic/env.py` calls `asyncio.run()` at module-import time** — [`backend/alembic/env.py`](../backend/alembic/env.py). Tests sidestep this via `asyncio.to_thread` in [`conftest._alembic_upgrade_head`](../backend/tests/conftest.py). Any future code that imports alembic from a running event loop (e.g. an admin endpoint that triggers migrations) will raise `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called when another event loop is running`. Fix: switch `env.py` to a sync Alembic invocation via `engine.sync_engine`.
- **`get_session` has no explicit rollback on exception** — [`backend/src/backend/db/session.py`](../backend/src/backend/db/session.py). Currently relies on SQLAlchemy autobegin/auto-rollback at session close. If a service adds explicit `session.begin()` blocks, wrap the yield in `try/except Exception: await session.rollback(); raise`.

### Schema
- **`TaskProgressRow.form_submission` is `sa.JSON`, not `JSONB`** — [`backend/src/backend/db/models.py`](../backend/src/backend/db/models.py). Store/retrieve works; JSON-path queries (`WHERE form_submission->>'key' = …`) and GIN indexing do not. When a service first needs either, run `ALTER COLUMN form_submission TYPE JSONB USING form_submission::jsonb` in its migration.
- **Python-side `uuid4` + `_utcnow` defaults** — every table in `db/models.py`. No UUID collision risk; `_utcnow` uses the app-server wallclock, so clock skew across replicas can produce non-monotonic `created_at`. Fix for multi-replica: `server_default=sa.func.gen_random_uuid()` / `sa.func.now()`.
- **`TaskProgressRow` has `updated_at` but no `created_at`** — once any update fires, the original enrollment time is lost. Add `created_at` if a service needs to query "when did the user start this task".

### Tooling hygiene
- **Alembic `path_separator` deprecation warning** — once per pytest run. Fix: add `path_separator = os` under `[alembic]` in [`backend/alembic.ini`](../backend/alembic.ini).

## Tech debt / review findings (Phase 5b)

Surfaced during Phase 5b (Google-stub auth + HS256 JWT + `/auth/google`, `/auth/logout`, `/me`). Address when Phase 6 replaces the Google stub with real JWKS verification, unless noted otherwise.

### Auth / security
- **`display_id` select-then-insert race** — [`backend/src/backend/services/display_id.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/display_id.py) + [`backend/src/backend/services/user.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/user.py). Two concurrent sign-ups with the same email-derived base can both pick the same candidate; the loser hits a unique-constraint `IntegrityError` and the router returns 500. Wrap candidate generation in a retry-on-`IntegrityError` loop, or switch to `INSERT … ON CONFLICT` with suffix regeneration, before production sign-ups land.
- **No JWT revocation / denylist** — `POST /auth/logout` is best-effort: tokens remain valid until `exp` regardless. Combine short access-token TTLs + a refresh-token rotation (or a small per-user revoked-jti table) when this starts mattering.
- **No `iss` / `aud` claims on minted tokens** — [`backend/src/backend/auth/jwt.py`](../backend/src/backend/auth/jwt.py). Single-service HS256 only; revisit if tokens ever cross service boundaries.
- **No rate limiting on `/auth/google`** — a noisy caller can force an unbounded number of upserts + JWT signatures. Add per-IP / per-email throttling at the ingress or a SlowAPI-style middleware.
- **`HTTPException(detail=str(exc))` on `/auth/google`** — [`backend/src/backend/routers/auth.py`](../backend/src/backend/routers/auth.py). Passes through the stub's verbose "Phase 5 stub" message, which also echoes the caller-supplied id_token fragment from `email-validator`. When Phase 6 swaps in real Google verification, replace with a constant `"Invalid id_token"` and log the underlying error server-side at WARNING.

### Dependencies
- **`email-validator` is an undeclared direct dependency** — used by [`backend/src/backend/auth/google_stub.py`](../backend/src/backend/auth/google_stub.py) via the `pydantic[email]` transitive. Pin explicitly in `backend/pyproject.toml` (`"email-validator>=2"`) so a future `pydantic` extra change can't silently break the auth stub.

## Tech debt / review findings (Phase 5c)

Surfaced during Phase 5c (profile completion + teams read/update + full join-request workflow). Address before production sign-ups land or as each route becomes hot; none block Phase 5d (content) or 5e (polish).

### Concurrency / consistency
- **`create_join_request` is non-atomic** — [`backend/src/backend/services/team.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/team.py). The 4 conflict checks (self-leader, member-of-this-team, member-of-any-team, has-pending-request) are separate SELECTs before the INSERT. Two concurrent requests by the same user can both pass and both INSERT, violating the at-most-one-pending invariant. Acceptable for single-tenant Phase-5 dev; tighten in Phase 6 with a partial unique index `WHERE status='pending'` on `join_requests(user_id)` + catch `IntegrityError` for a clean 409 retranslate, or wrap the precheck-then-insert in a `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` row lock on the requester's UserRow.

### Performance
- **`row_to_contract_team` N+1** — [`backend/src/backend/services/team.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/team.py). Members are batch-loaded but each pending join-request fetches its requester via a separate `session.get(UserRow, …)`. Fine for teams ≤ 10 members; if `GET /teams/{id}` ever becomes hot, batch the requester user loads with one `select(UserRow).where(UserRow.id.in_(…))` the same way members are batched today.
- **Reward-cascade N+1 in `approve_join_request`** — [`backend/src/backend/services/team.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/team.py). After approval, the function loops over all members (leader + new + existing) and calls `maybe_grant_challenge_rewards` per user, which itself runs 3-4 SELECTs (challenge defs, led team, led mems, joined link, joined mems, existing reward). For a 6-member team that's roughly 24 queries on a single approval. Acceptable for Phase-5 single-tenant scale; if approval becomes hot, batch the per-user reward check into one query that joins members × challenge defs × existing rewards, or move the cascade to a background job.

### Architecture
- **`services/team.py` mapper + lifecycle split is still pending** — the join-request workflow already lives in [`services/team_join.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/team_join.py) (`JoinConflictError`, `create/approve/reject_join_request`, `leave_team`) and the reward cascade sits in [`services/reward.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/reward.py). `services/team.py` is now ~229 LOC but still mixes two groups: mapper + search (`row_to_contract_team`, `search_team_refs`, `user_to_ref`, `caller_team_totals`) and team lifecycle (`create_led_team`). Phase-6 candidate: split into `team/queries.py` + `team/lifecycle.py` if either grows further.

## Tech debt / review findings (Phase 5d)

Surfaced during Phase 5d (tasks, submissions, rewards, leaderboards, news feed). Address before production traffic or as each route becomes hot; none block Phase 5e (polish).

### Performance
- **`leaderboard_users` / `leaderboard_teams` load every user/team into Python** — [`backend/src/backend/services/rank.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/rank.py). Both functions run `select(UserRow)` / `select(TeamRow)` unfiltered, sort by `(points DESC, id ASC)` in Python, then slice by cursor. Fine at Phase-5 dev scale; the module docstring has an explicit `TODO(phase-6)` pointing at the rewrite — a single SQL with `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC, id ASC)` projected as `rank`, keyset-paginated via `services.pagination.paginate_keyset` over `(points DESC, id ASC)`. Scales to 10k+ rows without loading the full roster per request.
- **`list_caller_tasks` still fans out `_required_ids` / `_steps_for` / per-task progress lookups** — [`backend/src/backend/services/task.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/task.py). Phase 5d hoists the caller's `completed_ids` out of the per-task loop, but the remaining helpers still run once per def. For 4 seed tasks that's roughly 4 × (requires + 2×steps + progress) ≈ 16 SELECTs on `GET /me/tasks`. Batch each helper across the full def list (one `select(...).where(task_def_id.in_(ids))` per helper) when the endpoint becomes hot or the def count grows past a few dozen.

### Concurrency / consistency
- **`submit_task` has a check-then-insert race** — [`backend/src/backend/services/task.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/task.py). Two concurrent POSTs to the same `(user, task_def)` pair can both see `existing is None` and both attempt to INSERT a `TaskProgressRow`; the `uq_progress_user_task` constraint catches the loser but the raw `IntegrityError` surfaces as HTTP 500 instead of 409. Same pattern as the Phase-5c `create_join_request` item — catch `IntegrityError` on INSERT and retranslate to `TaskSubmitError(409, "Task already completed")`, mirroring what `maybe_grant_challenge_rewards` now does for the reward path via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.

### Feature gaps
- **No reward-claim transition** — `Reward.status` declares both `"earned"` and `"claimed"` states, but no endpoint moves rows out of `"earned"`. The frontend prototype has no claim flow; the column is wired so Phase 6+ can add `POST /rewards/{id}/claim` (plus whatever fulfillment integration is real by then) without a schema change.
- **News has no admin publish path** — [`backend/src/backend/routers/news.py`](../backend/src/backend/routers/news.py) exposes only `GET /news`; rows must be inserted directly via DB or a migration seed. When editorial workflow becomes real, add an admin-guarded `POST /news` + `PATCH /news/{id}` (the role system itself is TBD; whatever Phase 6 auth settles on needs an admin flag).

## Tech debt / review findings (Phase 5e)

Surfaced during Phase 5e (idempotent dev seed + Phase 5 closeout). The seed items are all "intentional for dev seed" per the 5e plan's self-review; revisit at production hardening. The flaky JWT test is pre-existing — tracked here because it surfaced during the 5e final review.

### Concurrency / consistency
- **Seed is not race-safe** — [`backend/src/backend/seed.py`](../backend/src/backend/seed.py). Two concurrent `just seed` invocations can both pass the `select(TaskDefRow)` / `select(NewsItemRow)` existence check and both INSERT; the loser hits a unique-constraint `IntegrityError`. The module docstring admits this explicitly; acceptable for a dev seed. If seed ever runs at deploy time across replicas, switch the upserts to `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` or wrap them in `try/except IntegrityError: await session.rollback()`.

### Tooling hygiene
- **Seed is skip-on-conflict only; no force-refresh path** — [`backend/src/backend/seed.py`](../backend/src/backend/seed.py). Operators who change seed content (e.g., edit a T2 title) must `TRUNCATE` the affected tables manually to pick up the change — running `just seed` again is a no-op because the natural keys (`display_id` / `title`) already exist. Consider a `just seed-reset` recipe that truncates the seed tables + re-seeds, gated on `APP_ENV != "production"` so it can't wipe a prod DB.
- **Seed bypasses `services.display_id`; no drift guard** — [`backend/src/backend/seed.py`](../backend/src/backend/seed.py). T1-T4 `display_id` values are hard-coded to match the current validator shape. If [`services/display_id.py`](../backend/src/backend/services/display_id.py) ever tightens its rules (e.g., requires 3-digit suffixes like `T001`), the seed will silently continue emitting `T1` / `T2` / etc. Add a unit test that re-validates every seeded `display_id` through the current validator, or accept the coupling.

### Testing
- **`tests/test_jwt.py::test_decode_rejects_tampered_token` is flaky (~10%)** — [`backend/tests/test_jwt.py`](../backend/tests/test_jwt.py). Pre-existing on `main`; surfaced during the Phase 5e final review with 2/20 runs failing on an otherwise-clean `main`. The test flips one base64url character of the signature segment; when the flipped char decodes to the same byte value, HMAC verification still passes. Fix: flip every char in the signature segment, or base64url-decode the signature first and mutate a middle byte.

## Tech debt / review findings (Phase 4a)

Surfaced during Phase 4a (plumbing — TanStack Query v5, MSW v2, generated OpenAPI types, per-resource API modules, query/mutation factories, `UIStateProvider`, `AuthProvider` scaffolding; backend `DEMO_USERS` seed + γ-fanout join-requests + `seed-reset` + `gen-demo-accounts`). Scope was deliberately plumbing-only: no `useAppState()` callsite changed (count 36 = 36 vs. `main`). Items below are for plans 4b / 4c and production hardening.

### Plan fidelity
- **The 4a plan doc has stale API references** — [`superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-phase-4a-plumbing.md`](superpowers/plans/2026-04-20-phase-4a-plumbing.md). §A1/A2 reference `user_service.get_or_create_by_email`, `user_service.complete_profile`, and `team_service.create_join_request` — none of which exist. Real code: `services.user.upsert_user_by_email` and `services.team_join.create_join_request(session, *, team, requester)`; the seed inlines the profile-completion logic to mirror `routers/me.py::complete_profile`. §A5's `TRUNCATE task_def, news_item, users` had to become `TRUNCATE task_defs, news_items, users` (plural `__tablename__` values). The test sketches in §A1–A3 assume a `session_factory` pytest fixture that [`backend/tests/conftest.py`](../backend/tests/conftest.py) doesn't expose — implementers adapted to the session-scoped `engine` fixture with a local `_truncate_all(engine)` helper. Update the plan before any future replay.
- **`pnpm -C frontend dlx` writes to the wrong cwd** — [`justfile`](../justfile). `-C frontend` switches pnpm's project context but not the CLI's output-path resolution, so `-o src/api/schema.d.ts` originally landed at repo root instead of `frontend/`. Fixed via `cd frontend && pnpm dlx ...` in commit `fcc9537`. Worth checking future pnpm CLI invocations for the same trap.

### Auth / 401 wiring
- **`setSessionExpiredHandler` is registered at module import time in `session.tsx`** — [`../frontend/src/auth/session.tsx`](../frontend/src/auth/session.tsx). Importing the module installs the handler globally; it currently clears token + cache + pushes a toast but **does not navigate**. The handler also bypasses `setSignedIn(false)` and the `inFlightSignOut` dedup, so `useAuth().isSignedIn` stays stale after a 401 and concurrent loader-401s each fire `tokenStore.clear` + `qc.clear` + a toast independently. Plan 4c adds `router.navigate({ to: '/sign-in', search: { returnTo } })` — the cleanest hook is to mirror the existing `_setActiveQueryClient(qc)` pattern with a `_setActiveRouter(router)` holder, set from a top-level component and read by the module-level handler, and route the handler through `signOut({ reason: 'expired', returnTo })` so state + dedup + navigation converge. Don't try to re-register the handler from a hook.
- **`signOut(opts.returnTo)` is accepted but ignored** — plumbed through for plan 4c's router-navigate work. Callers can start passing it now; it no-ops until 4c wires it. The concurrent-safe `inFlightSignOut` guard is module-level, so 4c's `router.navigate` call must happen *inside* the guard (after `tokenStore.clear()`, before the `finally` releases) to avoid double-navigation on concurrent logouts.
- **No E2E 401 test yet** — [`../frontend/src/api/__tests__/client.test.ts`](../frontend/src/api/__tests__/client.test.ts) unit-tests the handler-dispatch path; the full loader → 401 → redirect → toast flow lands in plan 4c once the router is wired.
- **`signIn(email)` passes the email as `id_token`** — demo shortcut; the backend's `/auth/google` stub accepts this shape. When Phase 6 wires real Google auth, `signIn`'s signature changes and `GoogleAuthScreen` (plan 4b) must pass the real credential.

### Frontend API layer
- **`apiFetch` always sends `Content-Type: application/json`, even on GETs and empty-body POSTs** — [`../frontend/src/api/client.ts`](../frontend/src/api/client.ts). FastAPI tolerates it; semantically wrong and may trip odd CORS preflights or proxies. Gate on `init.body != null` when tightening.
- **Query-key prefix collision to watch** — [`../frontend/src/queries/keys.ts`](../frontend/src/queries/keys.ts). `qk.task(id)` is `["tasks", id]` (plural prefix) and `qk.myTasks` is `["me", "tasks"]`. Invalidating the bare `["tasks"]` clears `qk.task(*)` but **not** `qk.myTasks`. Mutations in `mutations/tasks.ts` correctly invalidate both; any mutation 4b/4c adds must do the same.
- **Default-invalidate maps in `mutations/*.ts` are deliberately conservative** — e.g. `useApproveJoinRequest` invalidates 6 keys including `["rank"]`. Plan 4c layers optimistic patches and should scope these down per-mutation.
- **`RankPeriod` is inlined in the generated schema** — [`../frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts`](../frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts) emits `"week" | "month" | "all_time"` per operation rather than a named schema. [`../frontend/src/api/rank.ts`](../frontend/src/api/rank.ts) defines a local union to compensate. Backend contract could expose it as a named `RankPeriod` enum (one-liner in [`../backend/src/backend/contract`](../backend/src/backend/contract)) to remove the drift.
- **`Paginated<T>` is hand-rolled in TS**, not imported from the schema — the generator emits monomorphised variants (`Paginated_NewsItem_`, `Paginated_TeamRef_`, etc.) with `next_cursor?: string | null` (optional); the hand-rolled type uses required-nullable. Both are structurally compatible with real responses; prefer the generated variants if a future refactor wants strictness.

### Testing
- **Node 25's experimental `localStorage` global shadows jsdom's and lacks the standard Storage methods** — [`../frontend/src/test/setup.ts`](../frontend/src/test/setup.ts). A 35-line shim feature-tests for `getItem` and installs a `Map`-backed Storage on both `window` and `globalThis` when the native one is broken. Load-bearing for every frontend test that touches `localStorage` (directly or via `tokenStore`). The feature-test auto-skips the shim once Node's API matures or jsdom is upgraded to handle this.
- **MSW is configured with `onUnhandledRequest: "error"`** — [`../frontend/src/test/setup.ts`](../frontend/src/test/setup.ts). Any new endpoint a test hits without a default handler in [`../frontend/src/test/msw/handlers.ts`](../frontend/src/test/msw/handlers.ts) or a per-test `server.use(...)` override fails loudly. Intentional — every new endpoint in 4b/4c needs an MSW entry.
- **MSW fixtures are deliberately minimal** — [`../frontend/src/test/msw/fixtures.ts`](../frontend/src/test/msw/fixtures.ts). One task, empty `rewardsList` / `newsList`, one team. Screens needing variety should extend per-test via `server.use(...)` rather than balloon the canonical fixture.
- **`_truncate_all(engine)` helper duplicated across backend seed tests** — [`../backend/tests/test_seed_demo.py`](../backend/tests/test_seed_demo.py) and [`../backend/tests/test_seed_display_id_drift.py`](../backend/tests/test_seed_display_id_drift.py) both inline the same `TRUNCATE ... CASCADE` helper derived from `SQLModel.metadata.sorted_tables`. When 4b/4c add seed tests, factor into [`../backend/tests/conftest.py`](../backend/tests/conftest.py) instead of adding a third copy.
- **No unit tests on `seed_reset.py` or `dump_demo_accounts.py`** — [`../backend/src/backend/seed_reset.py`](../backend/src/backend/seed_reset.py), [`../backend/src/backend/scripts/dump_demo_accounts.py`](../backend/src/backend/scripts/dump_demo_accounts.py). Both at 0% coverage. Drift-guard tests transitively prove part of the path; a ~10-line test for `render_label` + the `APP_ENV=prod` refusal branch would push coverage closer to 96%.

### Tooling hygiene
- **`just gen-types` must run before `pnpm -C frontend build`** — [`../justfile`](../justfile). `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts` is gitignored and regenerates deterministically from the backend's OpenAPI. CI must run the recipe before any typecheck/build step; no commit needed.
- **Ruff auto-fix drift accumulates across `just ci` runs** — two chore commits landed in 4a (`eeabe49`, `c14f771`) that only collapsed line wraps / reordered imports. Expected to surface again on future CI runs against `main`. Keep committing as `chore: ruff auto-fixes` to keep PR diffs readable, or wire a pre-commit hook.
- **`just seed-reset` not live-smoke-tested** — [`../backend/src/backend/seed_reset.py`](../backend/src/backend/seed_reset.py). Docker wasn't available in the 4a sandbox so the import was verified but `just seed-reset && just seed` end-to-end wasn't run. Exercise locally before 4b depends on it.

### Feature gaps
- **`Task.display_id` has no contract regex** — [`../backend/src/backend/contract/task.py`](../backend/src/backend/contract/task.py). Declares `display_id: str` with no `Field(pattern=...)` while `User` and `Team` both have one. Phase 4a's drift guard ([`../backend/tests/test_seed_display_id_drift.py`](../backend/tests/test_seed_display_id_drift.py)) pins the current shape `^T[0-9A-Z]+$` locally but this doesn't round-trip against a real contract. Add `Field(pattern=r"^T[0-9A-Z]+$")` to close the loop.

### Scope held for 4b / 4c
- **`frontend/src/state/AppStateContext.tsx` is still wired into every screen** — 4a touched zero `useAppState()` callsites (count locked at 36 vs. `main`). Plan 4b migrates read-side; plan 4c migrates write-side + deletes the context.
- **`frontend/src/types.ts` not touched** — plan 4b owns the snake_case rename + deletion alongside the screen migrations.
- **`_authed` route still reads `context.auth.user`** — plan 4b switches it to `tokenStore`.
- **Optimistic mutation patches not wired** — plan 4c layers them on top of the default-invalidate scaffolding in `mutations/*.ts`.
