# Phase 3 — Routing Design

Replace the single `useState<ScreenId>` in `frontend/src/App.tsx` with a real router. URLs become bookmarkable, browser back/forward works, and the route tree becomes the place to hang Phase 4 data loaders and Phase 6 auth guards.

## Goals

- Bookmarkable URLs for every screen a user can meaningfully land on.
- Browser back/forward works correctly across all navigations.
- Auth guards declared once, not per-screen.
- Extract `App.tsx` state into a provider so route components can read it without prop-drilling through `<Outlet>`.
- Leave Phase 4 a clean seam: route loaders will call TanStack Query, auth guards already in the right spot.

## Non-goals

- Zustand or other store migration (Phase 4 prep).
- Replacing mock data with real fetches.
- `RankScreen` mock-data extraction (tech-debt follow-up; out of scope).
- Real user IDs — `userIdFromEmail` stays as-is, replaced in Phase 4.
- Intent-preservation for deep-linked form pages (guest deep-linking to `/tasks/3/start` does not resume the form after sign-in).

## Library

**TanStack Router** (`@tanstack/react-router`), code-based route definitions (not the Vite file-based plugin). Route files under `frontend/src/routes/` are an organizational convention — the file names can be anything; the route tree is assembled explicitly in `router.ts`.

Picked over React Router for tight integration with TanStack Query (Phase 4): route `loaders` write into the same Query cache used by components, giving unified staleness rules and no double-fetch on navigation. Also provides type-safe search params (useful for filtered list screens coming in Phase 4) and a `beforeLoad` + typed `context` mechanism that lets auth guards be declared once on a parent layout route (useful for Phase 6).

History mode: HTML5 (`createBrowserHistory`). Vite dev server and Phase-7 hosts (Vercel/Netlify) handle SPA fallback to `index.html` trivially.

## Route tree

| Path | Screen | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `LandingScreen` | none (accessible to everyone, including authed users) |
| `/sign-in` | `GoogleAuthScreen` | authed + complete → `/home`; authed + incomplete → `/welcome` |
| `/welcome` | `ProfileSetupForm` (first-run mode) | not authed → `/sign-in`; complete → `/home` |
| `/home` | `HomeScreen` | `_authed` |
| `/tasks` | `TasksScreen` | `_authed` |
| `/tasks/:taskId` | `TaskDetailScreen` | `_authed` |
| `/tasks/:taskId/start` | `InterestForm` / `TicketForm` / `TeamForm` (dispatched by `taskId`) | `_authed` + cold load (no referrer from detail) → `/tasks/:taskId` |
| `/leaderboard` | `RankScreen` | `_authed` |
| `/me` | `MyScreen` | `_authed` |
| `/me/profile` | `ProfileScreen` | `_authed` |
| `/me/profile/edit` | `ProfileSetupForm` (edit mode) | `_authed`; incomplete profile → `/welcome` |
| `/rewards` | `RewardsScreen` | `_authed` |

**Naming rationale:**
- `/leaderboard` instead of `/rank` — conventional name for this screen type.
- `/tasks/:taskId/start` instead of `/tasks/:taskId/form` — action verb matches the CTA label ("開始任務") and feels native-app-like.
- `/welcome` instead of `/onboarding` — user-facing rather than product-team jargon.
- `/me/profile` nested under `/me` — matches the native-mobile "我" tab information hierarchy (intentional choice over the flatter web convention).

**Layout routes (no URL segment):**
- `__root` — wraps every route. Mounts `<GlobalStyles />` and the `<FormSuccessOverlay />` portal (the overlay must float over any route).
- `_authed` — auth guard only. Children inherit the redirect rules.

## Router context

Typed `context` passed to `createRouter` and refreshed on every `RouterProvider` render:

```ts
interface RouterContext {
  auth: {
    user: User | null;
    profileComplete: boolean; // derived: !!user?.zhName
  };
}
```

Guards read `context.auth` and `throw redirect({ to: ... })` as needed. Because context is re-provided on every parent render, auth-state changes immediately re-evaluate guards.

## Landing CTA

`LandingScreen`'s "開啟" button dispatches based on auth state (read via `useAppState()`):

- Guest → `navigate({ to: '/sign-in' })`
- Authed, profile incomplete → `navigate({ to: '/welcome' })`
- Authed, profile complete → `navigate({ to: '/home' })`

Landing remains accessible to authed users (they can revisit it freely — e.g., to show a friend).

## Form cold-load redirects

`/tasks/:taskId/start` is transition-only: reachable by navigating from `/tasks/:taskId` (task detail) or from `MyScreen`'s "建立隊伍" button. Cold loads redirect to `/tasks/:taskId`.

Implementation: when navigating to the form, set a history-state sentinel (`{ fromDetail: true }`). The route's `beforeLoad` reads `location.state` — if the sentinel is missing (direct URL typed, link shared, new tab), it redirects. A page reload does NOT drop history state per the HTML History spec, so a user who navigated to the form and then hit ⌘R stays on the form URL — but the form inputs are wiped because component state doesn't survive reload, so they see a blank form. Accepted behavior; spec'ing "reload = redirect" would require a sessionStorage-based sentinel, which is extra machinery for a scenario nobody hits in practice.

Same rule for `/me/profile/edit`: cold load redirects to `/me/profile`.

## State refactor — scope

Minimum needed to unblock routing. No store migration.

**`App.tsx` is deleted.** Its state and handlers move verbatim into an `AppStateProvider` (React Context).

**New file: `frontend/src/state/AppStateContext.tsx`**

Exposes via `useAppState()`:

```ts
{
  user, setUser,
  tasks,
  ledTeam, joinedTeam,
  successData, setSuccessData,
  handleSignIn,
  handleProfileComplete,
  handleProfileUpdate,
  handleSignOut,
  joinTeam, leaveLedTeam, leaveJoinedTeam,
  approveRequest, rejectRequest, renameTeam,
  simulateJoinApproved,
  completeTask,
}
```

`currentTaskId` is dropped entirely — the task ID now lives in the URL (`/tasks/:taskId` and `/tasks/:taskId/start`). Form components read it via `useParams()` and parse to number. `MyScreen`'s "建立隊伍" button uses `useNavigate()` to `/tasks/3/start` directly.

**`main.tsx` wraps:**
```tsx
<AppStateProvider>
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
</AppStateProvider>
```

**`rewardsFrom` state is deleted.** `RewardsScreen`'s back button uses `router.history.back()` (real browser history). Deep-linking to `/rewards` and tapping back goes wherever the browser history sends you.

**Screens stop receiving domain props.** `<HomeScreen />` reads from `useAppState()` + `useNavigate()` internally. Their presentational innards (layout, styling, event wiring) are unchanged.

**Task-detail routing:** `TaskDetailScreen` reads `taskId` from `useParams()`. No `currentTaskId` carried in context.

## Known tech debt carried forward (not addressed here)

From `docs/production-launch-plan.md` Phase-3 tech-debt section:

- `App.tsx` god-component — partially dissolved (state moves to provider) but not split by domain. Phase-4 prep can reducer-split or Zustand-ify.
- Task-3 "team progress" double-storage (`syncTeamTask`) — unchanged.
- `handleProfileComplete` setter-inside-setter — unchanged.
- `RankScreen` 43KB mock extraction — unchanged.
- `tasksProp || TASKS` fallbacks in screens — unchanged; screens will read tasks from context instead of props, so the fallback becomes unreachable and can be removed then (minor cleanup, not a refactor).
- `onSimulateJoinApproved` demo prop — exposed on context as `simulateJoinApproved`; tagged as demo-only in a comment.
- Mock join-request seed inside `handleProfileComplete` — unchanged.

## Testing

Add Vitest + Testing Library. Not yet present in the project.

**Dev dependencies:**
- `vitest`
- `@testing-library/react`
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`
- `jsdom`

**Config:** `frontend/vitest.config.ts` with `test.environment = 'jsdom'`, `test.globals = true`, `test.setupFiles = ['./src/test/setup.ts']` (imports `@testing-library/jest-dom`).

**Route-level tests** (`frontend/src/routes/__tests__/`):

1. **Landing CTA**
   - Guest → `/` → click "開啟" → navigates to `/sign-in`.
   - Authed incomplete → `/` → click "開啟" → navigates to `/welcome`.
   - Authed complete → `/` → click "開啟" → navigates to `/home`.
2. **Auth guard redirects**
   - Guest visits `/home` → redirect to `/`.
   - Authed incomplete visits `/me` → redirect to `/welcome`.
   - Authed complete visits `/welcome` → redirect to `/home`.
   - Authed complete visits `/sign-in` → redirect to `/home`.
3. **Task routing**
   - `/tasks/3` renders `TaskDetailScreen` for task 3.
   - `/tasks/999` renders not-found route.
   - `/tasks/3/start` cold load → redirects to `/tasks/3`.
   - Navigate `/tasks/3` → "開始任務" button → `/tasks/3/start` renders `TeamForm`.
4. **History behavior**
   - Navigate `/home` → `/tasks` → `/tasks/1` → back → `/tasks` → back → `/home`.

Tests mount the router with an in-memory history and a stubbed `AppStateProvider` value, asserting on rendered text and `router.state.location.pathname`.

**Manual smoke** — Phase-3 completion gate:
- `pnpm dev`, click every bottom-nav button, reload on each route.
- Use browser back/forward across every transition.
- Paste `/tasks/2` directly into a new tab (guest and authed).
- Paste `/tasks/2/start` directly — verify redirect to `/tasks/2`.
- Paste `/rewards` directly — verify back button doesn't crash.

## Dependencies

Added:
- `@tanstack/react-router`
